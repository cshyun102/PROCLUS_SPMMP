# PROCLUS_SPMMP
PROCLUS algorithm adaptation on SP-MMP

This algorithm is based on PROCLUS (PROjected CLUStering algorithm) from Aggarwal et al. (1999).
Additionally, the similarity and distance between two production paths are calculated based on Overlap index and 1-Overlap index, repectively.
Detailed explanation is on "PROCLUS_SPMMP.pdf"
